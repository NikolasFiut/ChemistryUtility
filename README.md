# ChemistryUtility
Summary
The objective of the application is to provide a centralized locale for utilities commonly used by 
chemistry students. Students will be able to enter data about their chemical into the app such as 
the name of the chemical, the initial concentration, and the initial volume. They will also be able 
to select which utility they wish to access. Crucially, the data inputted within the main view as 
well as all the specific utility views is carried through from one utility view to another, 
eliminating the need to re-enter data. Targeted utilities include a Molecular Weight calculator 
incorporating a periodic table selection as well as a Dilution calculator.
Feature Set
 Data Entry
o Generic data about the chemical is entered within the main view
o Data specific to each utility is entered within the specific utility view
o Data persists from one view and utility to another, across the spread of the 
application
o Main view has a button to clear the data entered
 Navigation
o All utilities will allow for a return to the main view
o Main view has a selection for the different utilities provided
 Utilities
o Molecular Weight Calculator
 Data Entry
 Use of a periodic table graphic to select the elements within the 
chemical
 Calculate button displays and stores the calculated molecular 
weight of the chemical
o Dilution Calculator
 Data Entry
 Allows user to enter in values for initial concentration, final 
concentration, initial volume, and final volume
 Allows user to select common units for volume and concentration
 Calculate button displays and stores outlying calculated value as 
well as displaying the quantity of diluting solution required in the 
final volume’s selected units
